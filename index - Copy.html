	<p class="post">This will be a very short blog entry, but I want to keep a record of every change that I make as it helps me to retain information.<br><br>
	I've recently been learning some JavaScript and jQuery and wanted to add some to my site. I've put a link to the Google hosted jQuery library after reading that this can result in faster load times than if I were to host the library myself.<br><br>
	So far I've only added a page fade-in, but it's a start.</p>

	<p class="post">Hello, and welcome to my website. This site will serve as a diary of sorts, detailing new skills that I acquire in my journey of learning web development and programming.<br><br>
	As you can see the site is pretty basic at the moment, consisting of only HTML and CSS, but not for long. As I learn new skills I will implement them on this website and include a blog post about what I have learnt.<br><br>
	The next step is to add some JavaScript and jQuery to make the site more animated. I will then go about making the site responsive, for an optimal experience no matter where the site is being viewed.<br><br>
	My end goal is to begin a career in web development and this website is the start of my portfolio.</p>
