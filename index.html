				<h3 id="dropdown_menu">Dropdown Menu</h3>
				<p class="post_date">25th April 2017</p>

				<p>Today I've added a dropdown menu to the mobile version of the site. It contains links to the other web pages I've created, and links that will jump you to each blog post. This makes navigation on a small screen much easier.</p>
				<p>The menu is a styled div that is hidden by default, when the "Navigation" link is clicked the menu displays below the navbar. This is done with a JavaScript funtion that is called when the navigation link is clicked.</p>
				<p>I've decided to hide the navigation link on the tablet/desktop versions of the site as they have all of the links in the right hand sidebar.</p>

				<h3 id="centred_page">Centred Page</h3>
				<p class="post_date">19th April 2017</p>

				<p>This evening I've created a <a href="centred\centred.html" target="_blank">web page</a> with a centred layout. The design is simple, but I wanted to make a responsive page with boxes and text that change their layout based on the size of the screen they are being displayed on.</p>
				<p>I made the page responsive by using CSS and media queries, this way I could make each layout appear exactly how I wanted. For the next page I make I may use a flexbox layout to learn more about that, from what I know about it already I think it could be more efficient for creating a content-rich responsive website.</p>

			<div class="content_box">
				<h3 id="tablet_layout">Tablet Layout</h3>
				<p class="post_date">16th April 2017</p>

				<p>Today I've added another media query to optimise the page layout when viewed on a tablet. Previously the site had the same layout for tablet and desktop viewing. Now when viewed on a tablet the site loses the side borders, with the main centre section taking up the full width of the screen. This makes the site much easier to read without any zooming in needed.</p>
				<p>Now that I feel happy with the layout of the site on mobile, tablet, and desktop I want to start focusing more on learning JavaScript and jQuery. I will also start to make different web pages like I did with the image gallery page to get more practise creating page layouts.</p>

				<h3 id="image_gallery">Image Gallery</h3>
				<p class="post_date">12th April 2017</p>

				<p>I've been on holiday for a week and so haven't made any progress with the site. Today I decided to make an image gallery page to practise making a different layout using CSS.</p>
				<p><a href="gallery\gallery.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is the page. Currently it only has three images that sit vertically when viewed on a phone, and horizontally when viewed on a tablet/desktop. Later I will add more images and maybe add another media query to make the layout different on a tablet.</p>
				<p>I've also added a "Links" section to the sidebar, so that any important links aren't lost within the blog posts.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="content_box">
				<h3 id="contact_form">Contact Form</h3>
				<p class="post_date">3rd April 2017</p>

				<p>Today I wanted to add a contact form to my site so that people can get in touch with me. After learning that this is mostly done using PHP (which GitHub Pages doesn't support), I started looking at other options.</p>
				<p>First I looked at the forms that Google Docs can produce, but after testing them I felt that the design was too intrusive as they use a lot of styling that cannot be changed. After a bit of searching I came across <a href="https://www.wufoo.com/" target="_blank">Wufoo</a>.</p>
				<p>Wufoo are an online form building service which offer both free and paid solutions, with different pricing plans based on your needs. I have created a free account, which limits the number of forms I can create and how many entries they can accept per month. As there is little (<i>no</i>) traffic coming to my site right now that suits me just fine.</p>
				<p>I may change the contact form to a custom made one once I start learning some PHP, but this Wufoo one will suffice for now.</p>
				<p>I've also added a scroll to top arrow at the bottom of the page using jQuery. On the mobile site I've also included a scroll to bottom arrow on the navbar as there is currently no way of navigating to specific blog posts, making it easier to read the blog in chronological order.</p>

				<h3 id="going_mobile">Going Mobile</h3>
				<p class="post_date">1st April 2017</p>

				<p>After deploying my site on GitHub Pages and seeing how awful it was when being viewed on my phone I decided to focus on making it more mobile friendly. After all, I do most of my internet browsing on my phone now, and so do most of the people I know.</p>
				<p>Whilst doing some research I found out that a lot of developers now create websites for mobile first, then use various styling techniques to make the site adapt to bigger displays - the opposite of what I had done.</p>
				<p>I've spent the last day reworking my CSS file and making some layout changes to correct this. Now all of the default styling is for the mobile version of the site and I've used a media query to make it scale to a desktop version.</p>
				<p>I am much happier with the layout of the site now, and by using the media query it makes it much easier to adjust the mobile site without affecting the desktop site and vice versa. For now I've only put in one media query, I may add a few more to better accommodate different display sizes.</p>

				<h3 id="deployment">Deployment!</h3>
				<p class="post_date">31st March 2017</p>

				<p>Up until now this site only existed on my computer. Over the past couple of days I've been reading about the best way to get my work online, and have decided to use GitHub Pages as it is free, and I want to learn how to use Git also.</p>
				<p>'ve never used a command line before so I had to learn how that works, but after around an hour I managed to clone the repository, commit some changes and push them to GitHub.</p>
				<p>I loaded up the site on my phone to see how it looks as this is how a lot of people are viewing the web nowadays and... it's not great. Just a scaled down version of everything and the header has been moved out of line somehow!</p>
				<p>Next up will be making the site responsive, and learning more about Git, as I've read that it's widely used and a valuable skill to have when working with other developers.</p>

				<h3 id="layout_adjustment">Layout Adjustment</h3>
				<p class="post_date">29th March 2017</p>

				<p>Today I wanted to adjust the layout of the site to make navigation easier once there is more content. I figured it would be easier to do this now while there isn't too much content to deal with.</p>
				<p>I've changed from the original layout which you can see <a href="images\sitev1.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>, to the layout that you are viewing now with a banner and navigation links to jump to specific blog posts.</p>
				<p>Whilst making these changes I came across a few problems trying to get the main content boxes and the navigation box positioned how I wanted them, problems like <a href="images\sitev2.jpg" target="_blank"><i>this</i></a>, and <a href="images\sitev3.jpg" target="_blank"><i>this</i></a>. After some trial and error and a bit of googling I came to the conclusion that I needed to restructure the HTML of the site, putting most of the body in a main div and adding a few extra divs.</p>
				<p>It took some time but I'm happy with the result.</p>

				<h3 id="adding_jquery">Adding jQuery</h3>
				<p class="post_date">25th March 2017</p>

				<p>I've recently been learning some JavaScript and jQuery and wanted to add some to my site. I've put a link to the Google hosted jQuery library after reading that this can result in faster load times than if I were to host the library myself.</p>
				<p>So far I've only added a page fade-in (which I'll probably remove later) to confirm that it is working, but it's a start.</p>

				<h3 id="the_beginning">The Beginning</h3>
				<p class="post_date">24th March 2017</p>

				<p>Hello, and welcome to my website. For the past few months I have been learning about web development and have decided to create this website that will act as a blog, detailing new skills that I acquire in my journey of learning web development and programming.</p>
				<p>As you can see the site is pretty basic at the moment, consisting of only HTML and CSS, but not for long. As I learn new skills I will implement them on this website and include a blog post about what I have learnt.</p>
				<p>The next step is to add some JavaScript and jQuery to make the site more animated. I will then go about making the site responsive, for an optimal experience no matter where the site is being viewed.</p>
				<p>My end goal is to begin a career in web development and this website is the start of my portfolio.</p>
