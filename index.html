				<p class="post">Up until now this site only existed on my computer. Over the past couple of days I've been reading about the best way to get my work online, and have decided to use GitHub Pages as it is free, and I want to learn how to use Git also.
				<br><br>I've never used a command line before so I had to learn how that works, but after around an hour I managed to clone the repository, commit some changes and push them to GitHub.
				<br><br>I loaded up the site on my phone to see how it looks as this is how a lot of people are viewing the web nowadays and... it's not great. Just a scaled down version of everything and the header has been moved out of line somehow!
				<br><br>Next up will be making the site responsive, and learning more about Git, as I've read that it's widely used and a valuable skill to have when working with other developers.</p>

				<p class="post_header"><span id="layout_adjustment">Layout Adjustment</span></p>
				<p class="post_date">29th March 2017<br><br></p>

				<p class="post">Today I wanted to adjust the layout of the site to make navigation easier once there is more content. I figured it would be easier to do this now while there isn't too much content to deal with.<br><br>
				I've changed from the original layout which you can see <a href="sitev1.jpg" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>, to the layout that you are viewing now with a banner and navigation links to jump to specific blog posts.<br><br>
				Whilst making these changes I came across a few problems trying to get the main content boxes and the navigation box positioned how I wanted them, problems like <a href="sitev2.jpg" target="_blank"><i>this</i></a>, and <a href="sitev3.jpg" target="_blank"><i>this</i></a>. After some trial and error and a bit of googling I came to the conclusion that I needed to restructure the HTML of the site, putting most of the body in a wrapper and adding a few more divs.<br><br>
				It took some time but I'm happy with the result.</p>

				<p class="post_header"><span id="adding_jquery">Adding jQuery</span></p>
				<p class="post_date">27th March 2017<br><br></p>

				<p class="post">This will be a very short blog entry, but I want to keep a record of every change that I make as it helps me to retain information.<br><br>
				I've recently been learning some JavaScript and jQuery and wanted to add some to my site. I've put a link to the Google hosted jQuery library after reading that this can result in faster load times than if I were to host the library myself.<br><br>
				So far I've only added a page fade-in (which I'll probably remove later) to confirm that it is working, but it's a start.</p>

				<p class="post_header"><span id="the_beginning">The Beginning</span></p>
				<p class="post_date">26th March 2017<br><br></p>

				<p class="post">Hello, and welcome to my website. This site will serve as a diary of sorts, detailing new skills that I acquire in my journey of learning web development and programming.<br><br>
				As you can see the site is pretty basic at the moment, consisting of only HTML and CSS, but not for long. As I learn new skills I will implement them on this website and include a blog post about what I have learnt.<br><br>
				The next step is to add some JavaScript and jQuery to make the site more animated. I will then go about making the site responsive, for an optimal experience no matter where the site is being viewed.<br><br>
				My end goal is to begin a career in web development and this website is the start of my portfolio.</p>
